# As people live longer, do they live healthier lives 
# (i.e., is a smaller fraction of life spent in poor health)?
# Follow the steps below to attempt to answer this question.

# First, you will need to reshape the data to create columns *by metric-year*
# This will create `hale_2016`, `hale_1990`, `le_2016`, etc.
# To do this, I suggest that you use the `pivot` function in the new
# tidyverse release:https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/pivot.html#wider
data_wide <- health_data %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, 
              values_from = c(hale, le, dalys))

# Create columns to store the change in life expectancy, and change in hale
data_wide <- data_wide %>% 
  mutate(hale_diff = hale_2016 - hale_1990,
         le_diff = le_2016 - le_1990)

# Plot the *change in hale* against the *change in life expectancy*
# Add a 45 degree line (i.e., where x = y), and save the graph to `charts/`
# What does this mean?!?! Put your interpretation below
ggplot(data_wide) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = le_diff, y = hale_diff)) +
  labs(title = "Life Expectancy Difference vs HALE difference",
       x = "Change in Life Expectancy",
       y = "Change in HALE") +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1) +
  xlim(-15, 20) +
  ylim(-15, 20)

ggsave("charts/change.png")
# And from the graph we can tell that since the curve is below the 45 degree line, 
# the change in Life Expectancy changes faster than the change in HALE.
